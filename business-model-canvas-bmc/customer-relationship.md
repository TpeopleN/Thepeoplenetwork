# Customer Relationship

Directed to a large market, it must adopt **a mass market relationship**, meaning that the company serves all users without discrimination or providing a personal experience to specific users. Automated tools are used to build the relationship with the customer, as he does not meet with an employee or a representative of the company, but is dealt with through remote communication tools such as messages/calls and technical support centers.
