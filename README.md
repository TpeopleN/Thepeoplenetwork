# Abstract

**ThePeople.Network**

**By People, For People**

* It’s a social media platform working just like Facebook "Meta" but not owned by a firm like Facebook. It’s owned by the community.
* The first of its kind ever as concept, BMC, Token Metrics and a new generation of investments "NGI" where people ( users/holders ) are getting richer together.
* Community get rewards for engagement( likes - follow - watching videos - sharing - etc ).
* Influencers get higher rewards as they are the main key partners. they should add content and compete to get more engagements and so as more rewards.
* Rewards will be money, As a major reward and other rewards.
* The influencers/users/content creators should guarantee that they will make more money than other platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and TikTok. And they will mostly do cause most of the money coming from the advertisement will go to the users and influencers not to a firm or a company like Facebook.
* Community will be very satisfied as there is no platform on earth rewards the community as they connect to each other ( Family/Friends kinship).
* The more the users are active and online on our platform the more they are connected to each other and the more they interact and engage with each others and of course the more they make money and other rewards.
* Which means Real social media network that is owned by the people and made for the people.
* &#x20;The website UI look like Facebook UI as possible with some changes to make it easy for the community and newcomers. To make them feel like they are on Facebook to be relaxed. considering it our top competitor.
* Later we will add more features and unique selling points
* The network can never go down like what happened with Facebook before, because our system will be depending on the community to run nodes ( mining ) to make the network alive. the more people on the platform the more nodes to run, the faster the network . And the faster are the transactions in Wallets.
* Users who run nodes get higher rewards and incentive. The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free. The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest.
* Users should be able to run nodes On all kind of Computers/Browsers and Devices even phones.
* The first 10000 post (photo or video or text or whatever may be handled as an NFT later.
