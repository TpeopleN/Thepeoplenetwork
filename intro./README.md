# Intro.

Social networking sites have become the most dominant sites on the Internet and the most visited sites. Despite this, the rate of introversion, loneliness, poverty and unemployment is the highest in the world. And despite the fact that They do not create the content, and the users/influencers are the ones who create the content, They sell customer data and put them at risk. And only they are the ones who make profits for displaying ads and other profiting methods, While the users come out with nothing except that they waste time , which is the most valuable asset ever, and their data was hacked and sold.
