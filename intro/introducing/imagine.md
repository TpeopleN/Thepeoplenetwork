# Imagine

\-We **believe** that Social Media platforms sell users data and never respect your privacy.

\- We **believe** that the users and influencers are the real key partners of every corner of every social media platform and they should be rewarded for that.

\- We **Know** that people waste a lot of time on social media platforms for no thing.

\- We **Know** that social media companies are making money they donâ€™t deserve.

\- We **Think** that the money coming from ads and other revenue streams should go to users not a centralized company.

**Imagine** if Facebook"META"  was owned by the community and its users instead of META. Imagine if  the users are sharing the profits that comes from ads and other revenue streams instead of META .
